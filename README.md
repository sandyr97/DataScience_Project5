Steps:
1.	Load data into data frame <br />
2.	Clean data <br />
a.	Remove NaN Values <br />
3.	Feature Engineering <br />
a.	Frequency of Product <br />
b.	Month <br />
c.	Day <br />
d.	Year <br />
e.	dataframe Product 1359 <br />
4.	Make most frequent product data frame <br />
5.	Visualization <br />
6.	Gradient Boosting <br />
7.	Random Forrest Regressor <br />
8.	Conclusions:

I chose to forecast the order demand for product 1359 because it is the product with the highest frequency 
in the dataset. I used visualization to understand the trends and distribution of the product's order demand. 
I then applied gradient boosting and random forest regressor as forecasting models to determine the demand 
product 1359. The scores for both of these models indicated inaccuracy. Adding more features to the model 
will probably improve the accuracy.
