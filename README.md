Steps:
1.	Load data into data frame <br />
2.	Clean data <br />
a.	Remove NaN Values <br />
3.	Feature Engineering <br />
a.	Original data frame <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.	Frequency of Product <br />
b.	Product 1359 data frame <br />
  i.	Month <br />
  ii.	Day <br />
  iii.	Year <br />
iv.	Average Order Demand <br />
4.	Visualization <br />
a.	Distribution <br />
b.	Trends <br />
5.	Gradient Boosting <br />
6.	Random Forrest Regressor <br />
7.	Conclusions: <br />
I chose to forecast the order demand for product 1359 because it has the highest frequency in the dataset. I used visualization to understand the trends and distribution of the product's order demand. I then applied gradient boosting and random forest regressor as forecasting models to determine the demand product 1359. The scores for both of these models indicated inaccuracy. Adding more features to the model will probably improve the accuracy.
